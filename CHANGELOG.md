# Changelog

All notable changes to Kiwibro are documented here.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-10-21

First release: a local-first AI agent for Linux with a native-feel browser GUI.

### Added

- **Local chat with LM Studio** — streaming replies, reasoning shown collapsed,
  markdown and copyable code blocks, stop/abort, automatic model listing with
  loaded state, context size and tool capability. Switch models from the header
  without touching transcripts or memory.
- **Context engine that never breaks** — token estimation, dynamic per-model
  budgets, rolling conversation summaries injected into the prompt, tool-output
  trimming and hard fallbacks. Context-limit errors from LM Studio are recovered
  automatically instead of surfacing.
- **Memory without chaos** — async extraction of durable facts after replies,
  normalisation + fuzzy dedupe, six categories (fact, preference, project, person,
  decision, plus pinned), FTS search, editable/deletable from the memory sheet.
  Memory is global, model-independent and capped.
- **Agent tools with permissions** — `web_search`, `fetch_page`, `read_file`,
  `list_files`, `write_file`, `replace_in_file`, `run_command`, `remember`.
  Read-only tools run automatically; writes and commands ask with an inline
  approval card (Allow / Always / Deny, 120 s timeout). `Always` persists.
- **Safety rails** — workspace sandbox with symlink-safe path containment,
  SSRF-guarded page fetching, command blocklist, timeouts and output caps,
  loopback-only server with DNS-rebinding host guard, 4 MiB request cap.
- **Native Ubuntu feel** — dark GNOME-style window, hand-drawn kiwi mark, app
  icons and a `.desktop` launcher that opens a Chrome app window. Browser GUI
  only: no Electron and no external assets.
- **Fully local** — SQLite (WAL + FTS5) in `~/.local/share/kiwibro`, workspace in
  `~/Kiwibro`, loopback server, no telemetry, no CDN/fonts.
- **Quality gate** — 67 pytest unit/API tests and 54 deterministic fake-LM
  end-to-end checks (streaming, approvals, compaction, recovery, security),
  plus a Playwright browser rig and a GitHub Actions CI workflow.

### Notes

- Browsers with ES modules and `ReadableStream` are required (current Chrome,
  Chromium, Firefox, Edge).
- LM Studio must run its local server (default `http://127.0.0.1:1234`).
- Memory extraction runs asynchronously after a reply; the UI refreshes counts
  shortly after `done`, when the memory sheet opens and on window focus.
